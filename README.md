# LLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be extremely useful for analyzing text data, including comments associated with cases, to extract common themes and patterns within a specified timeframe. LLMs provide a deep understanding of language context, sentiment, and thematic elements in text data

Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch installed.

Took two comments as examples and tried the sentiment analysis and got the sentiment score
Took a dataset of food reviews and tried out a few cases to check the score, I have only taken the comments from the dataset

Using the Dataset i tried to find a few key words
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used for unsupervised topic modeling, extracting hidden topics from a collection of documents without prior labeling, aiding in document understanding and organization.
